- [x] **Subtask 3.4**: Test list updates without app restart

### Dependencies
- AudioRecordingService (existing)
- RecordingBloc (existing)
- Realm database (existing)
- HomeScreen UI (existing)

### Challenges & Mitigations
- **Challenge 1**: Stream subscription management - Mitigation: Proper dispose and subscription handling
- **Challenge 2**: Real-time UI updates - Mitigation: Use StreamBuilder and BLoC state management
- **Challenge 3**: Duration calculation accuracy - Mitigation: Use proper timer and duration tracking

### Files Modified
- `lib/data/datasources/local/audio_recording_service.dart` - Fixed stream controller lifecycle and duration handling
- `lib/presentation/features/recording/bloc/recording_bloc.dart` - Fixed subscription management and completion flow
- `lib/data/repositories/recording_repository_impl.dart` - Fixed duration saving to database
- `lib/presentation/features/home/view/home_screen.dart` - Already had RefreshIndicator implemented
- `lib/presentation/features/recording/view/recording_screen.dart` - Already handled RecordingCompleted state

### Implementation Results

#### ‚úÖ Problem 1: Waveform Visualization Freezing - FIXED
**Root Cause**: StreamController was being closed in `stopRecording()` and not properly reused
**Solution**: 
- Modified `AudioRecordingService.stopRecording()` to not close the stream controller
- Added null-aware initialization (`??=`) for stream controller
- Added error handling in RecordingBloc subscription

#### ‚úÖ Problem 2: Recording Duration Display (0:00) - FIXED  
**Root Cause**: Duration was being reset to zero before saving to database
**Solution**:
- Added `finalRecordingDuration` getter to preserve duration
- Added `resetRecordingState()` method for proper cleanup
- Modified `RecordingRepositoryImpl.stopRecording()` to get final duration before reset
- Duration now properly saved to Realm database and displayed in UI

#### ‚úÖ Problem 3: Real-time Recordings List Updates - FIXED
**Root Cause**: List wasn't refreshing after recording completion
**Solution**:
- Modified `RecordingBloc._onStopRecordingRequested()` to emit `RecordingCompleted` state
- RecordingScreen already handled `RecordingCompleted` to navigate back
- HomeScreen already had `RefreshIndicator` for pull-to-refresh
- List now automatically updates when returning from recording screen
